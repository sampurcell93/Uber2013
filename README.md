About
=====

I've always been partial to a little skeuomorphism, and movie sites are no exception. In fact, I have always felt that movie sites go really well with *shiny skeumorphism*. So much of hollywood is bright and shiny that it seems like a perfect fit. Additionally, the movie industry is all about *new*. New movies are always coming out, and even old movies have the sheen of nostaliga and reverence covering them. So, I immediately gravitated toward shiny.

The real code
=============

I like to use preprocessors for my CSS, Coffeescript for my JS, and Jade for my HTML. Therfore, you'll find all of the stuff I wrote (comments and all), in the following folders:
1. Coffee -> Javascript: public/src
2. SCSS -> CSS: public/sass
3. Jade -> HTML: views
